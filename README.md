# Auth-Skills-Practice
This project was created to improve my skills in authentication and user management in web applications. The main focus is on implementing essential functionalities, such as login, logout, updating, and deleting data, applying the principles of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). All functionalities were **developed exclusively using front-end technologies**, showcasing how core concepts can be implemented without relying on back-end systems. Furthermore, it was an opportunity to consolidate knowledge in systems architecture and good development practices.


## Implemented Features
- **User Registration:** Allows users to create accounts with basic data validation.
- **Login and Logout:** User authentication with session management.
- **Data Update:** Users can securely edit their personal information.
- **Account Deletion:** Option to permanently delete user accounts.
- **Data Listing:** Querying information from the database.


## Technologies Used
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** LocalStorage, IndexedDB


## Future Improvements
- Implement token-based authentication (JWT) for added security.
- Add password recovery functionality via email.
- Create different user roles (e.g., admin vs. regular user).
- Improve mobile responsiveness.
- Add activity logging for user actions.
